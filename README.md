### **🚀 Dojo-1.1: Lightweight AI Query-to-Data Pipeline**  

---

## **What is Dojo-1.1?**  
**Dojo-1.1** is an **intermediate lightweight experiment** focused on **efficient query-to-data transformation**, optimized for **API-first AI workflows**. It builds on previous iterations by **reducing complexity, eliminating deep retrieval pipelines, and prioritizing fast, structured output processing.**  

Unlike full-scale orchestration platforms, **Dojo-1.1 acts as a streamlined AI-powered API query agent**, executing **direct API interactions with high accuracy and low overhead.**  

💡 **Why Dojo-1.1?**  
✅ **Minimal API Calls** → Smart query-to-endpoint mapping eliminates redundant requests  
✅ **Fast Data Transformations** → Uses **Pandas-based direct processing** (avoiding heavy LLM loads)  
✅ **Lightweight & Deployable** → Modular agentic approach ensures **domain-specific customization**  
✅ **Cross-Domain Testing** → Optimized for **F1 queries, financial data, and climate analytics**

## **🔹 Key Features & System Design**  

🚀 **Agentic Query Processing** → Uses **Phidata-based modular agents**  
🚀 **Efficient Data Transformations** → Direct **NumPy/Pandas processing**, skipping multi-hop reasoning  
🚀 **Optimized API Calls** → Ontology-driven **endpoint selection** for **query efficiency**  
🚀 **Scalability for Domain-Specific Use Cases** → Primed for **structured API-driven data extraction**

## **📊 Performance Metrics**  

| **Capability** | **Best Accuracy** | **Challenges** |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Query → Multi-Endpoint Selection | **100%** | Relies on Ontology Mapping & Context Filtering |
| Query → DataFrame Transformation | **96%** | Works well in domain-specific applications, but lacks universal scalability |
| DataFrame → Analytics Code Generation | **Not Tested** | Future step for AI-driven automated reporting |

    A[User Query] --> B[Query Processing Agent]
    B --> C[API Endpoint Selection]
    C --> D[Data Retrieval Agent]
    D --> E[Data Transformation Agent]
    E --> F[Structured Output Generation]
```

🚀 **Key Enhancements Over Previous Versions**  
✅ **Agent-Based Query Processing** → Handles query interpretation & API mapping separately  
✅ **Direct Data Transformation** → No deep retrieval pipelines, simplifying processing  
✅ **Smart API Call Optimization** → Adaptive filtering ensures **low-latency, high-relevance** results
